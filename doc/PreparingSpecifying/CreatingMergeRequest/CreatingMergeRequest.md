# Completing an Issue and creating a Merge Request

After _committing_ all changes, which are necessary to complete the _Issue_, into the local _feature branch_ it is time for consolidating your contribution into the public _develop_ branch (_origin/develop branch_).

For contributing your work, click on the source control symbol (the branch icon in the menu bar to the left).

In a first phase of the process, you have to assure that your contribution is not creating any conflicts while _merging_ into the public _develop branch_ (_origin/develop branch_).  
For this purpose, you have to _merge_ the _origin/develop branch_ into your local _feature branch_. (Please, be aware that this is the opposite direction from the actually intended.)  

* Open the menu at the repository, which you would like to contribute to, click on "Branch zusammenf√ºhren"...  
![RequestingMerge7](./pictures/RequestingMerge_07.png)

* ... and chose the _origin/develop branch_ from the list.  
![RequestingMerge8](./pictures/RequestingMerge_08.png)

* If there would be any _merge conflicts_, they would show up now.
* After analyzing two conflicting versions of the code, you could decide for the versions (current, incoming or both) to become part of your local _feature branch_.

* Save the files, which got changed during resolving all conflicts by Ctrl+s and _stage_ them for being _committed_ during the _merge_ of the _origin/develop branch_ into your local _feature branch_.2

* Confirm the _merge_ of the _origin/develop branch_ into your local _feature branch_ ...  
![RequestingMerge11](./pictures/RequestingMerge_11.png)

* ... and _push_ your local _feature branch_ with the resolved conflicts to the remote repository (creates or updates remote _feature branch_).  
![RequestingMerge12](./pictures/RequestingMerge_12.png)

In the second phase of the process, you have to create the _Merge Request_ for consolidating the remote copy of your _feature branch_, which is now cleared from conflicts, into the _origin/develop branch_.  

* Click on the pull request icon at the repository you would like to change.  
![RequestingMerge13](./pictures/RequestingMerge_13.png)

* VSCode is now automatically filling the source and target branch into a form and you just have to double check. Please, add a _Merge Request_ message, which is complying the chapter about [Formulating Merge Request Messages](../FormulatingCommitMessages/FormulatingCommitMessages.md) and click Create.  
![RequestingMerge14](./pictures/RequestingMerge_14.png)

* Alike in the following picture, the _Merge Request_ does not create any conflicts and can directly be _merged_ after reviewing the changes.  
![RequestingMerge15](./pictures/RequestingMerge_15.png)

As you can see from the pictures, the _Merge Request_ is not involving your local repository.  
The _Merge_ is happening exclusively in the remote repository on GitHub.  

After conducting the _merge_  
* the _Issue_, which initiated creation of the _feature branch_, will be closed
* and the remote copy of the _feature branch_ will be deleted.

Please, take care that you are also deleting your local _feature branch_ after you got informed about the successful _merging_.  
Otherwise your local repository will turn into a dump and you will get confused by mixing _branches_ of similar sounding names.

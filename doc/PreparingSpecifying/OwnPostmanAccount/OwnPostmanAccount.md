# Creating an Postman account

Each user needs an own account linked to his Telefonica email address.  
A new user can be created directly from Postman:

Upon pressing the *Create Account* button a creation dialogue appears in the browser.  
Fill the dialogue according to the following rules:
* Email: your Telefonica email address ending with telefonica.com
* Username: \<first name\>-\<last name\>

After that your new user should automatically be logged in to Postman.

Notify the plattform owner of your new user account in order to get added to the MW_SDN_Domain team.
Send an email to: Thorsten.Heinze@telefonica.com

In case of logging for the first time with a new user account also make sure that the proxy settings are set up again (see [here](../InstallingPostman/InstallingPostman.md) for information on how to do that.)

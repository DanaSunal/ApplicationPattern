# Creating an Postman account


**Account creation**  
Each user needs an own account linked to his Telefonica email address.  
A new user can be created directly from Postman:

Upon pressing the *Create Account* button a creation dialogue appears in the browser.  
Fill the dialogue according to the following rules:
* Email: your Telefonica email address ending with telefonica.com
* Username: \<first name\>-\<last name\>

After that your new user should automatically be logged in to Postman.

**Display name change**  
Whereas the username does not allow to have blanks in it the display name does.  
It should have the format "\<first name\> \<last name\>".  
To change it click on the account button in Postman and select *View Profile*.

The profile will be displayed in the browser. There press *Edit Profile*:

And change the *Name* field to the required format and apply the change by pressing *Update Profile*:

**Account activation**  
At this point the account still needs to be activated, which can be done from the email which will be sent by the Postman team. Press the *Confirm My Email* button to do so:

**Become a member of the team**  
The last step is to notify the plattform owner of your new user account in order to get added to the MW_SDN_Domain team.  
Send an email to: Thorsten.Heinze@telefonica.com  

After some time you will get an email inviting you to the team. To do so just press the *Join* button in the email.

# Structure of ApplicationNames

The Name of the application must describe the application's role in the modular application layer in two to four meaningful words.  

Think about an institution or authority that provides one or several services to the public, like for example:
* RegistryOffice
* TypeApprovalRegister

The name must be written in UpperCamelCase and it must be unique.  

The uppercase letters of the name will serve as an abbreviation (e.g. RO, TAR).  

This abbreviation needs also to be unique within the modular application layer.

Nouns, which I don't wanna see: System, Application, Service and Meerschweinchen.

# Creating the ApplicationRepository

Instantiation of the ApplicationRepository defines the starting point of the application specification and implementation process.  

The ApplicationOwner must be defined.  

Sponsoring (incl. budget) of the implementation of the Application must be assured.  

It must be assured that the Application will fit into the overall concept of the architecture. So purpose, respectively use cases must be well understood, defined and agreed with the PlattformOwner and the group of ApplicationOwners.

As soon as high probability of successfully accomplishing the process is assured, the ApplicationOwner has to informally request the PlatformOwner for provisioning of an ApplicationRepository.

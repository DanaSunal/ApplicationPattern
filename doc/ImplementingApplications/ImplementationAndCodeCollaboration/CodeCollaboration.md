## Code Collaboration 

As mentioned , we are doing the code collaboration in GitHub. 

To start working on a new project , make sure a repository is created for the new project with appropriate application name. 

Switch to the develop branch of the project and create a folder named “server”. The server-side implementation will be merged into this folder.

And to work on feature development , create issue in the corresponding repository and start working on the issues. 

Please look into this article to get a clear idea about [working on issues using visual studio code](../../PreparingSpecifying/ProcessingAnIssue/ProcessingAnIssue.md)

## What Does an API-First Approach Mean?
An API-first approach involves developing APIs that are consistent and reusable, which can be accomplished by using an API description language to establish a contract for how the API is supposed to behave.  Establishing a contract involves spending more time thinking about the design of an API. It also often involves additional planning and collaboration with the stakeholders providing feedback on the design of an API before any code is written.

In API first approach , an API specification document will be specified first for the requirement. An API specification explains how the API functions and the results to expect when using the API. One of the most popular API description languages is OpenAPI (OAS 3, formerly called Swagger).

When properly defined, a developer can understand the requirement , generate stub from the specification, implement the business logic and deploy the implemented application. Also , by using this specification , test suites stubs can be generated which can be further complemented to automate the application testing.

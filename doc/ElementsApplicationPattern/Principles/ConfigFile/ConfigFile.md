## CONFIGfile 
The values defined in a CONFIGfile indicate the initial state of the application as soon as it is installed. This can be customized if require.
The CONFIGfile provides information about , 

- the Microservice and its purpose, 
- the exposed services, 
- the consumed services,
- relationships between the exposed and the consumed services,
- hints on how the application interact with rest of the Microservices.

The template of the load file is consistent across all the Microservices in the application layer. The load file is formatted in JSON format that inherits the concepts of ONF CoreModel.

To test the application pattern we are using CI/CD methodology which includes continuous integration and continuous delivery/continuous deployment. CI means the name itself explains us, developer makes the changes continuously and do continuos build, tests until requirement fulfilled, CI will make this process easier and it automatically integrates the changes into current repository and test the applications. CD is like continuous delivery/continuous deployment an automated delivery process which includes testing and delivery the SW. Once everything is fine in automation testing, continuos deployments performed in production environments.

## Overview 
  Docker is an open source platform that enables developers to build, deploy, run, update and manage containers of applications. it is used to call as configuration management tool that is used to automate the deployment of software in lightweight containers which can run on any OS environment. These containers help applications to work efficiently in different environments. docker containization is very friendly in building and deploying the applications and below are advantages over docker.

## Advantages of Docker : 
* lighter weight process
* Easy and faster configuration
* Infrastructure independent
* Automated container creation
* Container versioning
* Container reuse

## Docker objects :

### DockerImage: 
A Docker Image is a read-only file with a bunch of instructions. When these instructions are executed, it creates a Docker container.

### Docker container: 
A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.

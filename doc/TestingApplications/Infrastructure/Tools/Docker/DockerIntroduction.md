## Docker objects :

### DockerImage: 
A Docker Image is a read-only file with a bunch of instructions. When these instructions are executed, it creates a Docker container.
### DockerFile: 
Dockerfile is a simple text file that consists of instructions to build Docker images. DockerFile automates the process of Docker image creation.
### Docker container: 
A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.

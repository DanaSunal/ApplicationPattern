# Scripts

### High Availability Script 

HighAvailability is an ability to moniter/operate the services continuoesly with minimal of zero failures. current arctitecture have multiple instances of applicationpattern running and if one of them crashes, we still have the other instances working and available. HA will make sure that all instances are up and running, If required will resume the crashed instances also.


TODO: Please, describe the general targets, concepts, principles and rules for applying Scripts in the Microwave SDN Laboratory.
Don't put explicit code or steps for executing the code here, but into a separate document for each script after discussing the concepts.
Please, be frugal with picture and graphics that might out-date soon.

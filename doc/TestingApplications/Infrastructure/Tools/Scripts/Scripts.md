# Scripts

### High Availability Script 


TODO: Please, describe the general targets, concepts, principles and rules for applying Scripts in the Microwave SDN Laboratory.
Don't put explicit code or steps for executing the code here, but into a separate document for each script after discussing the concepts.
Please, be frugal with picture and graphics that might out-date soon.

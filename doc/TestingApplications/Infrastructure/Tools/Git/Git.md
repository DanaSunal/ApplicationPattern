Git is a free and open source distributed version control system and easy to learn. Github is used more efficiently to manage git repositories on centralized server. 
Git makes it easy to use by users:
    
- Keep track of code history
- Collaborate on code as a team
- See who made which changes
- Deploy code to staging or production
